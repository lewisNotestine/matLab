matLab
======

This is some of the MatLab code I wrote as part of my work in the Linguistics Department in 2005, added for old time's sake! I used this to write a reaction time task and a "lexical decision" task for non-words, etc. There's also some code that does a Fourier Transform if anyone wants to do that with MatLab. Many of these are similar to each other and are likely different versions of the same functionality...
