matLab
======

This is some of the MatLab code I wrote as part of my work in the Linguistics Department; I used this to write a reaction time task and a "lexical decision" task for non-words, etc.  There's also some code that does a Fourier Transform if anyone wants to do that with MatLab.  Many of these are similar...
